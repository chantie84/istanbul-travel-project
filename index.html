            <h2>Why Istanbul?</h2>
            <h3>It’s the best city on Earth. Here’s why.</h3>
            <p>
              The Outstanding Universal Value of Istanbul resides in its unique
              integration of architectural masterpieces that reflect the meeting
              of Europe and Asia over many centuries, and in its incomparable
              skyline formed by the creative genius of Byzantine and Ottoman
              architects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Istanbul is a unique part of the world because of not only its
              history, but also its function as a bridge from the point of
              economic, social and cultural interrelations. There are many
              cities, which are settled near a water source; however, Istanbul
              is the only city that is settled between two continents and two
              seas.

                <p>
                  Topkapi Palace has secret passageways that were used by the
                  Ottoman Sultans to access different parts of the palace,
                  including the harem and Hagia Sophia. The Imperial Treasury or
                  the Enderun Treasury of Topkapi Palace holds unique artifacts,
                  like the thrones of various Ottoman Sultans, their suits of
                  armour, centuries of weapons, and precious gemstones. Topkapi
                  Palace houses the legendary “Spoonmaker's Diamond,” one of the
                  largest cut diamonds in the world, among its treasures.

                  Everything is spectacular in the Grand Bazaar, a mythical
                  place in the Turkish metropolis where it’s easy to lose
                  yourself and be amazed. It’s impossible not to think of the
                  tales of The One Thousand and One Nights when you enter this
                  fabulous place.

                <p>
                  The origin of the Grand Bazaar dates back to the time of
                  Sultan Mehmet II in the 15th century. The ruler started the
                  construction of covered bazaars, known as “bedesten”, which
                  were dedicated to the sale of fabrics and silks. They
                  gradually included other types of products. The guild
                  workshops were grouped by zones and over time the streets that
                  housed them were covered by vaults, leading to the appearance
                  of the Grand Bazaar as we know it today.

                <h4>Blue mosque</h4>
                <p>
                  It is said that, when Shah Jahan of India ordered a white
                  marble mausoleum inlaid with precious stones (the Taj Mahal)
                  to be built for his wife, he also planned to construct one for
                  himself on the opposite bank of the Ganges. The second
                  mausoleum, which would have been built from black marble, was
                  never built.

                <h5>Fact's about blue mosque</h5>
                <p>
                  The six minarets that Ahmed ordered to be built flanking the
                  Blue Mosque drew sharp criticism from followers of Islam,
                  since only Mecca, the most sacred of all mosques, had six. As
                  a result, the sultan had no choice but to then add a seventh
                  minaret to the great temple. The reason behind the decision to
                  build six minarets is even more unusual.
